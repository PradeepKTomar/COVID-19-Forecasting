Covid 19 forecasting using Machine learning
Welcome to our COVID-19 forecasting and prediction project using x-ray images. This project aims to use machine learning algorithms to predict COVID-19 cases based on chest x-ray images.

Motivation
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide, making it crucial to predict the disease's spread and forecast the number of cases in the future. One of the methods to predict COVID-19 is by analyzing x-ray images of infected patients. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict COVID-19 based on chest x-ray images.

Dataset
We have used kaggle available datasets of chest x-ray images of COVID-19 positive and negative patients. We have also used other datasets for validation purposes.

Methodology
We have developed a machine learning model using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict COVID-19 based on chest x-ray images. The model was trained on the dataset of chest x-ray images and validated on other datasets.

Results
The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the validation dataset. We have also used the model to predict COVID-19 cases based on the number of infected patients.

Usage
To use our model, clone the repository and run the predict.py script on your chest x-ray images. The script will return the prediction of COVID-19 based on the input image.

Contribution
We welcome contributions from other researchers to improve the accuracy of our model. Feel free to raise issues, submit pull requests, and collaborate with us on Github.
